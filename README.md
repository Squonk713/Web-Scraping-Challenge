# Web-Scraping-Challenge

In this assignment, I built a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page. 

## Step 1 - Scraping

Initial scraping was conducted using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter.

### Data to be scraped:

### NASA Mars News

### JPL Mars Space Images - Featured Image

### Mars Facts

### Mars Hemispheres

## Step 2 - MongoDB and Flask Application
